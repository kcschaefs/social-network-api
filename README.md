## User Story

```md
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data
```
## Tasks
- Create models for Mongo Database
- Create routing for users, thoughts, friends, and reactions
- CRUD for users
- CRUD for thoughts
- Create and delete friend relationships
- Create and delete reactions to thoughts
- Seed database using Insomnia
- Test functionality

## My Learnings
- How to use Mongoose to create and manage a MongoDB
- How to CRUD using Mongoose
- Much of this hw was using skills I learned in past projects, the main difference was introducting MongoDB/Mongoose

## Future Improvements
- build out a client-side view to interact with the backend
